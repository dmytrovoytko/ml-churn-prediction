## Problem statement

Subscription-based businesses are all around us - from classics like telecom to cloud services, Netflix and ChatGPT. Customer retention is a critical factor for the long-term success of such companies. Acquiring new customers is often significantly more costly - "from 5 to 25 times more expensive than retaining an existing one." (Harvard Business Review) - "It makes sense: you don’t have to spend time and resources going out and finding a new client — you just have to keep the one you have happy". Therefore increase of customer retention can lead to significant growth of profits over time. 
By accurately predicting customer churn, businesses can proactively implement targeted retention strategies to reduce customer attrition and increase revenue.
I decided to use Machine Learning to predict customer churn, and chose a [Gym customers features and churn dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adrianvinueza/gym-customers-features-and-churn).
